The ultimate bot for your PC!!!! (vote for me please -> what do you of this??? bug??? give me idea for new version)
This program allow you to get files and email from a computer where this prog is installed
I am at work and i've got email but not internet access , no floppy or cd drive ...
I make this bot to execute some command on my computer at home (DSL connnected)
So i can get from my work (or anywhere ex: friend , cybercafe -> yahoomail etc... ) some files from my hard drive or from internet
i can consult my home email from an other computer that have email or internet access
you can disable some command just by modifying .ini file

How to use botmail???
it's very simple execute botmail on your computer
configure your server parameters...

if you have a look in the .ini file you can see many sections
1st : 
[Botcom]
Sendmecom=sendme
vmailcom=vmail
executecom=execcmd
aspipage=aspipage
botstop=stopme

A Botcom is a command that you must put in the subject from email

[vmailcmd]
getemailliste=getlis
getnewemail=getnew
getallemail=getall
getselemail=getsel

this is the command that you must put in body text of email if you want to use vmail cmd

[server]
smtpserver=smtpuunet.coeyman.fr
popserver=popuunet.coeyman.fr
username=christophe

this is the server's parameter

[execcmd1]
KeyName=Botmail
AttachName=Botmail.exe
PathName=C:\program~1\VBMail\VBMAIL.exe
Subject=Botmail send
texte=Vote for BOTMAIL
