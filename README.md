The ultimate bot for your PC!!!! (vote for me please -> what do you of this??? bug??? give

This program allow you to get files and email from a computer where this prog is installed

I am at work and i've got email but not internet access , no floppy or cd drive ...

I make this bot to execute some command on my computer at home (DSL connnected)

So i can get from my work (or anywhere ex: friend , cybercafe -> yahoomail etc... ) some files from my

hard drive or from internet

i can consult my home email from an other computer that have email or internet access

you can disable some command just by modifying .ini file
